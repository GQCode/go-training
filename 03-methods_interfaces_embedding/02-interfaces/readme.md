## Interfaces - Methods, Interfaces and Embedding

Interfaces provide a way to declare types that define behavior. Then struct and named type can declare methods and implement this behavior. When a struct or named type implements the behavior declare by an interface, it satisfies the interface and can be assigned as values of the interface type. This leads to providing polymorphic behavior in our programs.

## Notes

* Methods that implement interfaces with a value receiver support values and pointer calls.
* Methods that implement interfaces with a pointer receiver require pointer calls only.
* Interfaces are reference types, don't share with a pointer.
* This is how we create polymorphic behavior in go.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

**Part A** Declare an interface named Speaker with a method named SayHello. Declare a struct named English that represents a person who speaks english and declare a struct named Chinese for someone who speaks chinese. Implement the Speaker interface for each struct using a pointer receiver and these literal strings "Hello World" and "你好世界". Declare a variable of type Speaker and assign the _address of_ a value of type English and call the method. Do it again for a value of type Chinese.

**Part B** From exercise 1, add a new function named SayHello that accepts a value of type Speaker. Implement that function to call the SayHello method on the interface value. Then create new values of each type and use the function.
